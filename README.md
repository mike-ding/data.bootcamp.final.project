# data.bootcamp.final.project

This project was completed by Michael Ding in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2019. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof- has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and bibliography.

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by the NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Project Description

This project will examine the degree to which price fluctuations of avocados, a key ingredient used by Chipotle, can affect the price of Chipotle's stock. A major buyer of Hass avocados in specific, Chipotle estimates that it uses upwards of 400,000 each day nationally. The goal is to visualize and understand the relationship between prices.
